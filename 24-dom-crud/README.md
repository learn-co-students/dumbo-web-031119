# DOM CRUD

## Learning Goals
* Use `DOMContentLoaded` to run JavaScript once the DOM is ready
* Identify when to use `const`, `let`, and `var`
* Use `.forEach` to iterate
* Create DOM elements using event listening
* Update DOM elements using event listening
* Delete DOM elements using event listening
* Use `.dataset` to bind information to an HTML element
* Use `.preventDefault()` to stop an HTML element's default behavior

*BONUS*
* Understand the difference between implicit and explicit return


## Our App So far
As a user I now have...
* ~~nicer styling on my app~~
* ~~the weird `<em>` tag removed~~
* ~~my list of nice compliments added~~


# Deliverables
As a user I want...
*FAKE*
* ~~to find my first button and alert "HELLO!" when I click it~~
* ~~anything I click on should have an `officer-eric` added to it~~
* ~~to hover over any li and have it's background color change to `pink`~~

*REAL*
* ~~to have random photos of cats for each compliment~~
* ~~to be able to add a "hug" to a compliment and see my hug count go up accordingly~~
* ~~to add my own compliments~~
* ~~to delete a compliment (I want a trashcan)~~
`<div class="trash">🗑</div>`
* to favorite the best compliments (clicking favorite adds an `officer-eric` next to the favorite button)
`<div class="favorite">⭐️</div>`
