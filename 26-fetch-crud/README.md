# fetch CRUD

## Learning Goals
* Explain what a SPA is
* Build out full CRUD in our app using fetch
* Manipulate the DOM in conjunction with our CRUD fetch calls
* Explain Optimistic vs Pessimistic Rendering

*BONUS*
* Refactor our code
* Walk through breakpoints / debugger

## Our App So Far
As a user I now have...
* nicer styling on my app
* my list of nice compliments added
* the ability to add a "hug" to a compliment and see my hug count go up accordingly
* the ability to add my own compliments
* the ability to delete a compliment (I want a trashcan)
* the ability to favorite the best compliments (clicking favorite adds an `officer-eric` next to the favorite button)
* random nicolas cage gifs instead of cute cats
* the ability to save all of my data about my compliments
* the ability to use my saved data to create all of my compliments

*REVEIW*
* update my hug count and have it save to my database
* random zoo portraits instead of nicolas cage gifs `https://www.zooportraits.com/art/`
